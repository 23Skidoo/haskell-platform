= 2010.1.0 release = 

Package changes:

 # Added extensible-exceptions: don't list.
 # Remove packedstring
 # Time moves back into the base set.
 # Not upgrading to parsec 3!
 # Not adding OpenGL 2.4, 
        -- would add OpenGLRaw >=1.1.0.0, GLURaw >=1.1.0.0,
                        StateVar -any, ObjectName -any, Tensor -any
 # Ship a newer haddock? No.
 # Added deepseq to the HP.

 # Due to ghc's dependency on Cabal, we can't upgrade Cabal as part of
     the HP build.
         + Bug in Cabal, meaning local package db's were dropped.
                - work around: manually register.
         + Bug in Cabal on Windows -- wait for 6.12.2
 
 # New update to cabal-install coming.
 # Policy: Modify script to include only --global packages in a global install,
     and always include --user packages in user installs
