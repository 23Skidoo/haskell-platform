To build the Haskell Platform for Mac OS X:

1) If you have the proper GHC installer package:
    create a subdirectory "dist" here
    move or sym-link the package into dist
You should have a file there named seomthing like
    GHC-7.0.4-i386.pkg
    GHC-7.0.4-x86_64.pkg

2) Edit the makefile so that GHC_ARCH is set to the architecture you're building

3) Be sure you have hscolour installed on your system, and on your path.

4) Edit ../generic/tarball/scripts/build.sh and un-comment out the flag
    HADDOCK_FLAG="--hyperlink-source"

5) Run
    make ghc

6) If you are building the 32-bit version, Edit the ghc script in:
    dist/root/Library/Frameworks/GHC.framework/Versions/7.0.4-i386/usr/bin/ghc-7.0.4 
Modify the last line to include this option, just before "${1+"$@"}" ending:
    -optl"-Wl,-read_only_relocs,suppress"

7) Update your cabal package list:
    cabal update

8) Run
    make rewrap
    make source

Note: If this fails, you may have to fiddle with things in ../src/generic to
get Build.hs to build. This can be done with your already installed Haskell
system. If things fail during this step, you'll probably have to remove
../src/generic/haskell-platform-* to get them to run again.

9)
    make config
    make build
    make package
    make scripts
    make doc
    make polish

10) Build the finall installer:
    make installer

This will ask you for your password so it can sudo the tree to root. When PackageMaker starts up, if this is a 64-bit build, add the a requirement to the
distribution itself of 64-bit instructions available with suitable message like:

    This is the 64-bit distribution of Haskell Platform. This machine does
    not support 64-bit instructions.

Now click Build... and choose a suitable name and location for the result.

11) Go have some tea.
