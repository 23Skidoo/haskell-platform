Download the Mac OS X installer here:

* **<a href="http://lambda.haskell.org/platform/download/2012.2.0.0/Haskell%20Platform%202012.2.0.0%2032bit.pkg" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/mac'); ">Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0 for Mac OS X, 32 bit</a>** (10.6 or later)

* **<a href="http://lambda.haskell.org/platform/download/2012.2.0.0/Haskell%20Platform%202012.2.0.0%2064bit.pkg" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/mac'); "> Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0 for Mac OS X, 64 bit</a>** (10.6 or later)

* <small>*Pick the 32-bit vesion, unless you have a specific reason to use the 64-bit version.<br />The 32-bit one is slightly faster for most programs.*</small>

After downloading:

* Double click the package icon to start the installer.
* Follow the instructions.

----

**Notes:**

*Only one architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) can be installed at a time.*

*The command line development tools are required prior to installation.*
<br />If you have <tt>/usr/bin/gcc</tt> available in a shell, you should be good to go. If not:

  * On OS 10.6, use Xcode 3.2 or later: Choose the "Customizeâ€¦" button during installation and choose **UNIX Development**

  * On OS 10.7, choose one of the following:

    * Download and install **Command Line Tools for Xcode**.
      Despite the name, you don't need Xcode installed!

    * After installing Xcode 4.3, choose **Preferences**, then
      pick the **Downloads** panel. There you can download and
      install the **Command Line Tools** as an optional component.
      This installs the same package as listed in the above option.

    * If you have Xcode prior to 4.3, depending on how you installed it,
      you may already have the command line tools. If not, consider the
      first 10.7 option above.

  * *The command line tools and/or Xcode can be downloaded for free
    from [Apple's developer website](http://developer.apple.com), you
    do need to register as a developer (also free).*


<i>For Mac OS X 10.5 please use the 2010.2.0.0 installer, below.</i>
