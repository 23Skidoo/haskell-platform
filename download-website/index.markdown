% Haskell Platform Download (BETA)

%

The first beta release of the [Haskell Platform], version 2009.2.0, is now available. Downloads and instructions for various operating systems are listed below.

Please note that this is a beta release. We do not expect everything to work perfectly and we would appreciate feedback. Issues related to the packaging and installers can be filed in the [platform trac].

There will be a couple more minor releases in the 2009.2.x series:


These will incorperate your feedback on the installers. They will also include minor bug-fix updates in some packages. For example we expect to update to ghc-6.10.3 and to include OpenGL package updates.

Windows
-------

haskell-platform-2009.2.0.exe

MacOS X
-------

The installer for MacOS X is not yet available. 

Linux distributions
-------------------

A few distributions already support the Haskell Platform. We expect more to follow soon.

 * Arch
 * Gentoo
 * Nix / NixOS

If your distribution is not yet listed then you will need to use the source tarball.

Source tarball
--------------

haskell-platform-2009.2.0.tar.gz

This is a traditional "./configure; make; make install" style .

The source tarball requires that you already have ghc-6.10.x installed.
